## CORE FEATURES

### 1. TEMPORAL SENTIMENT MAPPING
The engine categorizes market states into three distinct visual and logical layers:

* **BULLISH ACCUMULATION:** High-intensity green pulse animations coupled with dynamic bar charts representing strong buying pressure.
* **BEARISH DISTRIBUTION:** High-contrast red visual cues triggered by "MKKT_SENTIMENT_SHORT" logic, signaling high selling pressure.
* **TRADER'S DILEMMA:** A unique psychological layer that analyzes the emotional friction points during high-volatility events.

### 2. VOICE-ACTIVATED FINANCIAL ASSISTANT
A dedicated voice interface allows for hands-free temporal analysis. Users can query the system for historical sentiment trends and rapid market summaries without manual input.

### 3. LIGHTNING ACTIONS

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### TEMPORAL ANALYSIS LOGIC
The system utilizes a custom "use client" architecture to manage real-time state transitions without page reloads. The interface reacts to data streams through:

* **Framer Motion:** Handles the high-frequency UI transitions and "pulse" effects.
* **Lottie-React:** Renders complex vector animations that represent market volatility (Bull/Bear states).
* **SVG Noise Filtering:** A custom overlay used to provide a tactical, high-contrast aesthetic that reduces cognitive load during long trading sessions.
